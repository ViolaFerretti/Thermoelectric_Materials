# Performance Simulation of Thermoelectric Materials
Thermoelectric materials are able to convert a temperature gradient into electrical energy, or vice-versa. 
It has been reported that the majority of primary energy is wasted as heat. So, the development of thermoelectric devices is essential
to utilize this waste heat and convert it into useful electric power. To continue this research and to direct it towards the realization
of novel thermoelectric materials, simulations that, based on the characteristics of the material, are able to compute the
thermoelectric quantities of such materials are of crucial importance. In particular, the proposed
simulation is focused on 2D materials and, taking their band structure as a starting point, is
able to calculate the Seebeck coefficient $S$, the electric conductivity Ïƒ, the thermal electronic
conductivity $\kappa_e$ and the fgure of merit $ZT$, depending on three main parameters: the energy
gap, the chemical potential and on the thermal lattice conductivity.

The simulation can be done based on three different models describing the band structure:
- single-parabolic-band model
- double-parabolic-band model
- double-Dirac-band model

All three models are based on Boltzmann transport theory in the linear response regime in the relaxation-time approximation.
